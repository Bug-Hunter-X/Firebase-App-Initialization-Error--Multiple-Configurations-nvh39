The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the `initializeApp` method is called multiple times with different configurations. This can happen if you accidentally initialize Firebase in multiple places in your application, such as in different modules or components.  The error message is not always clear and can be difficult to track down. For example, a common error is `FirebaseError: Firebase App named '[DEFAULT]' already exists with different options`.
