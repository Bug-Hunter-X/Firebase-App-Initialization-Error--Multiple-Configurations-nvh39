To solve this problem, ensure `initializeApp` is called only once in your application. A common approach is to initialize Firebase in your application's main entry point, such as your `index.js` file, or a dedicated Firebase initialization module.  Then, import and use the Firebase instance across the application.

Refer to `multiple-init-solution.js` for a corrected version.  The key change is the use of a singleton pattern to ensure that Firebase is initialized only once, regardless of how many times the initialization function is called.
