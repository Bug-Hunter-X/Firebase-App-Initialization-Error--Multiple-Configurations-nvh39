# Firebase App Initialization Error: Multiple Configurations

This repository demonstrates a common, yet difficult-to-debug error in Firebase applications.  The issue arises when the `initializeApp` method is called multiple times with differing configuration options. This results in an error that can be hard to pinpoint, often obscuring the root cause. This repo provides a clear example of the problem and a solution.

## Problem

The `multiple-init.js` file demonstrates the incorrect initialization.   Due to multiple calls to `initializeApp` with slightly different configurations (e.g., different database URLs), the application fails.
